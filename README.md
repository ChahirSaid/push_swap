# Push_swap  
## Because Swap_push isnâ€™t as natural  

Push_swap is a project that challenges you to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions while minimizing the number of actions. To succeed, you'll need to implement and optimize sorting algorithms, selecting the most efficient approach from multiple possibilities.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
- Manipulate stacks using specific operations  
- Implement and optimize sorting algorithms  
- Aim for the lowest number of operations  

## ðŸ”— Algorithm Visualization
